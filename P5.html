<b1 style="font-size:30px">A Brief History of Meditation</b1>

<p style="font-size:20px">Meditators swear by the practice’s ability to bring enduring positive change into their lives. But where does meditation come from? What are its origins? Who thought it up?
  <br><br><br>We don’t really know. The earliest records of meditation practice date from approximately 1500
    <br> years BCE (Before Common Era). It seems to have been an integral part of the earliest forms of
      <br> the Vedic, or early Hindu, schools in India. In the 6th to 4th centuries BCE, the Chinese Taoist and
        <br> Indian Buddhist traditions began to develop their own versions of meditation practice. Further
          <br> west, early forms of meditation practice were developed by such notable figures as Philo of
            <br> Alexandria, the Desert Fathers of the Middle East, and Saint Augustine.

<br><b1 style="font-size:30px">The origins of meditation</b1>
<p style="font-size:20px">The English word “meditation” stems from meditatum, a Latin term meaning “to ponder.”
  <br> Although we can’t know when, exactly, people began to meditate, experts agree that the practice probably began
    <br> many thousands of years ago, before the birth of modern civilization. When scholars look to establish the origins
       <br> of meditation, they first have to decipher ancient texts and recorded hieroglyphs to find references to this discipline.
          <br>Several archaeological findings suggest that hunter-gatherers were practitioners of some forms of meditation, as were early shamans.
             <br>Their knowledge was passed down orally from one generation to the next, helping to lay the crucial foundations of modern meditation.

<br>
<br>
<p style="font-size:20px">A group of neuroscientists wanted to figure out whether years of meditation had changed the brain of an expert monk.
   <br>Led by Dr. Richard Davidson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, they connected 256 electrodes to a Tibetan monk named Matthew Ricard,
     <br> who had given up a career in science and spent decades meditating in the Himalayas. Dr. Davidson and his colleagues were astonished by Ricard’s brain signature,
       <br>having never seen anything like it before. The activity in his left prefrontal cortex (responsible for subduing negative emotions) and abnormal gamma wave levels (suggesting signs of bliss)
        <br>led them to dub him “the happiest man in the world.”<br><br><br>

But this wasn’t an isolated finding. As it turns out experienced meditators across the board show fascinating improvements to their brains. And even novices who learn meditation,<br>
 practicing over the course of a few weeks, begin to see changes take place.<br><br><br><br><br>
